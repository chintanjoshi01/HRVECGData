## Introduction

HRVECGData is an Android application designed to collect and analyze Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) data using the [Polar BLE SDK](https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk). The app allows users to connect to Polar BLE devices, stream data in real-time, and perform comprehensive analyses on the gathered data.

## Features

- **Connect to Polar Devices:** Easily connect to compatible Polar BLE devices to gather HRV and ECG data.
- **Real-time Data Streaming:** Stream HRV and ECG data in real-time with minimal latency.
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Utilize built-in algorithms for detailed analysis of HRV and ECG data.
- **Data Export:** Export collected data in various formats (CSV) for further processing and analysis.
